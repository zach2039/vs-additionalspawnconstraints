Stability Spawn Lib
=================

A server-side mod that allows other mods to control region stability requirements for spawnable entities; this mod doesn't do anything on its own!

Overview
--------

To use, define floats in entity attributes of `minSpawnRegionStability` and/or `maxSpawnRegionStability` to enable control of spawn conditions related to region stablity. Each attribute has a valid range of `0.0` to `1.0`, and is related to the region stability of an area in the world.

Future Plans

 - None, atm.

Known Issues
